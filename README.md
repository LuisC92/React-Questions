1. ### What is React?

    React is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

2. ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

3. ### What is JSX?

    *JSX* is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for *JavaScript XML*). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

    In the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return(
          <div>
            <h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}</h1>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

4. ### What is the difference between Element and Component?

    An *Element* is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. *Elements* can contain other *Elements* in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.

    The object representation of React Element would be as follows:

    ```javascript
    const element = React.createElement(
      'div',
      {id: 'login-btn'},
      'Login'
    )
    ```

    The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object:

    ```
    {
      type: 'div',
      props: {
        children: 'Login',
        id: 'login-btn'
      }
    }
    ```

    And finally it renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`:

    ```html
    <div id='login-btn'>Login</div>
    ```

    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
      <div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>Login</div>
    ```

    Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ onLogin }) => React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin },
      'Login'
    )
    ```

5. ### How to create components in React?

    There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements:

        ```jsx harmony
        function Greeting({ message }) {
          return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>

        }
        ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:

        ```jsx harmony
        class Greeting extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>
          }
        }
        ```

6. ### When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?

    If the component needs *state or lifecycle methods* then use class component otherwise use function component.
    *However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle  methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component.*
    *So, it is always recommended to use Function components, unless you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries *

7. ### What are Pure Components?

    *`React.PureComponent`* is exactly the same as *`React.Component`* except that it handles the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for you. When props or state changes, *PureComponent* will do a shallow comparison on both props and state. *Component* on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box. Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever `shouldComponentUpdate` is called.

8. ### What is state in React?

    *State* of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    Let's create a user component with message state,


    ```jsx harmony
    class User extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
          message: 'Welcome to React world'
        }
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

    ![state](images/state.jpg)

    State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.

9. ### What are props in React?

    *Props* are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component's `render()` method.

    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:

    ```jsx harmony
    <Element reactProp={'1'} />
    ```

    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

    ```
    props.reactProp
    ```

10. ### What is the difference between state and props?

    Both *props* and *state* are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

11. ### Why should we not update the state directly?

    If you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

    ```javascript
    //Wrong
    this.state.message = 'Hello world'
    ```

    Instead use `setState()` method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

    ```javascript
    //Correct
    this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })
    ```

    **Note:** You can directly assign to the state object either in *constructor* or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

12. ### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState()`?

    The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState()` is **asynchronous** the callback function is used for any post action.

    **Note:** It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.

    ```javascript
    setState({ name: 'John' }, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'))
    ```
